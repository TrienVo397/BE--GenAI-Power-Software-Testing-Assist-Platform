You are a Quality Assurance specialist in a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Your task is to review and refine the Markdown requirements document you created above. The goal is to ensure the document is exhaustive, complete, accurate, concise, and not redundant.

Firstly, look at the Markdown requirements document you created above.

To analyze and improve this document, follow these steps:

1. Carefully read through the entire requirements document.

2. Think of the following aspects:
   a. **Completeness:** Are all necessary requirements covered?
   b. **Accuracy:** Are the requirements correctly stated?
   c. **Conciseness:** Are any requirements overly wordy or complex?
   d. **Redundancy:** Are there any duplicate or overlapping requirements?
   e. **Clarity:** Are all requirements clear and unambiguous?
   f. **Formatting:** Is the Markdown properly structured and formatted?

3. Based on your analysis, take the following actions:
   a. Remove any redundant requirements.
   b. Combine overlapping requirements where appropriate.
   c. Split complex requirements into simpler, more manageable ones.
   d. Clarify any ambiguous or vague requirements.
   e. Add any missing requirements that are essential for the project.
   f. Improve Markdown formatting for better readability.
   g. Update the summary statistics to reflect changes.

4. Review your refined document to ensure it meets the criteria of being exhaustive, complete, accurate, concise, and not redundant.

5. **Provide your final refined requirements document in complete Markdown format.** Your response must be a well-formatted Markdown document ready to be saved as requirement.md file. ONLY create the markdown text, DO NOT generate anything else.
