# LLM Prompt Template for ISTQB-compliant Test Checklist Generation
# 
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLM:
# You are an expert test analyst following ISTQB standards.
# Generate a comprehensive test checklist based on the extracted requirements.
# Each checklist item represents a high-level test scenario that needs verification.
# Use this checklist as input for detailed test case generation.
#
# GENERATION GUIDELINES:
# 1. Review all functional and non-functional requirements
# 2. Create test scenarios covering requirement verification
# 3. Apply risk-based testing principles for prioritization
# 4. Follow ISTQB test design techniques (equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, etc.)
# 5. Ensure traceability back to specific requirements
# 6. Consider positive, negative, and edge case scenarios

# ISTQB Test Design Approach
test_design_strategy:
  approach: "[Black-box/White-box/Gray-box testing approach]"
  techniques_used:
    - "[Equivalence Partitioning]"
    - "[Boundary Value Analysis]" 
    - "[Decision Table Testing]"

# PRIORITY CLASSIFICATION (ISTQB-aligned):
# - "Critical" (Blocks release, core business functions)
# - "High" (Important functionality, user-facing features)
# - "Medium" (Supporting features, workarounds available)
# - "Low" (Cosmetic, nice-to-have features)

# TEST TYPE CLASSIFICATION (ISTQB standard categories):
# - "Functional" (Business logic verification)
# - "Performance" (Non-functional: speed, load, scalability)
# - "Security" (Authentication, authorization, data protection)
# - "Usability" (User experience, accessibility)
# - "Compatibility" (Cross-platform, browser, integration)
# - "Reliability" (Availability, fault tolerance, recovery)
# - "Integration" (Component/system integration)
# - "Regression" (Existing functionality verification)
