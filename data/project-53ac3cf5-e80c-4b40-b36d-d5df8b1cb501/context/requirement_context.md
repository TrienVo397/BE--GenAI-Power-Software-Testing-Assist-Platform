## ReqView Application Project Context Summary

### Project Overview
ReqView is a requirements management application designed for software and system products. It provides a comprehensive solution for capturing, managing, tracing, and analyzing requirements throughout the product development lifecycle. The application is designed to run offline without server connection, making it suitable for environments with restricted connectivity or security requirements.

### Key Features
* **Document Management**: Create, open, save, and template-based generation of requirements documents
* **Requirements Capture**: Document and organize requirements with custom attributes
* **Traceability**: Establish links between requirements with support for different link types
* **Analysis Tools**: Analyze requirements coverage and impact of changes
* **Import/Export Capabilities**: Support for MS Word, Excel, PDF, HTML, and CSV formats
* **Review Functions**: Comment on and review requirements
* **Search and Filter**: Find and filter requirements based on various criteria

### Technical Specifications
* **Platform Support**: Runs in Chrome or Firefox browsers on Windows, Linux, and Mac
* **Offline Operation**: Functions without server connection
* **Data Storage**: Uses human-readable open file format (JSON)
* **Integration**: Designed for easy integration with third-party applications
* **User Interface**: GUI with menus, toolbars, buttons, and keyboard/mouse controls

### Target Users
The application is designed for:
* Requirements engineers and business analysts
* Project managers
* Quality assurance specialists
* Development teams
* Stakeholders involved in requirements review

### Requirements Structure
The requirements are organized into 35 distinct items across four categories:
* **Functional Requirements**: Core application capabilities (document management, traceability, etc.)
* **Technical Requirements**: Platform support, data storage, performance
* **User Interface Requirements**: GUI components and usability
* **Risk Levels**: Requirements are classified as High (11), Medium (22), or Low (2) risk

### Dependencies and Assumptions
* The application is based on ReqView v1.0 released in 2015
* Requirements are organized in a hierarchical document structure
* The system assumes modern browser capabilities for rendering and interaction
* Integration with MS Office products relies on specific data formats (HTML, CSV)

### Potential Testing Challenges
* **Cross-browser compatibility** testing across multiple platforms
* **Import/export functionality** with various file formats
* **Traceability matrix** verification with complex requirement relationships
* **Performance testing** with large documents containing hundreds of requirements
* **Offline functionality** verification in various network conditions

This requirements set represents a comprehensive requirements management application with emphasis on document management, traceability, and analysis capabilities, all designed to function in an offline environment with modern browser support.
